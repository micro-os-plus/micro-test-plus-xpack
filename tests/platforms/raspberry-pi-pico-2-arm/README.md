# platforms/raspberry-pi-pico-2-arm

Support files for building Cortex-M33 tests to run on the
Raspberry Pi Pico 2 board without the SDK.

## Prerequisites

- [Raspberry Pi Pico 2 or Pico 2 with headers](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html#pico2)
- [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/debug-probe/)

The **Pico 2 with headers** is a newer version, with a small 3 pin connector soldered,
which can be directly connected to the Debug Probe, without any
custom wiring.

The **Debug Probe** is a cheap SWD (Serial Wire Debug) probe, implementing
CMSIS-DAP; for best results, this probe requires a recent OpenOCD (>= 0.12),
the current Raspberry OpenOCD fork (0.11.x) is too verbose for the use with
semihosting.

An alternate setup can be a pair of Pico's (preferably the initial model,
without the debug connector soldered) and some custom wiring, with one
Pico running the [Picoprobe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe)
firmware.

## Include folders

The following folders should be passed to the compiler during the build:

- `include`

## Source files

- `src/hooks.cpp` — the `micro_os_plus_startup_initialise_hardware_*`
  hooks (clock bring-up, `SystemInit()`); also instantiates the
  `activityLed` (`platform::pico2::led_green`) and powers it up.
- `src/led-green.cpp` — `platform::pico2::led_green` driver for the
  onboard green LED (GPIO25), implemented directly on the RP2350 CMSIS
  peripherals.

## Memory range

The applications are built for the following memory range:

- FLASH: 0x1000_0000-0x103F_FFFF (4 MB)
- RAM: 0x2000_0000-0x2007_FFFF (512 KB main SRAM)
- SCRATCH: 0x2008_0000 0x2008_1FFF (two 4 KB banks)
- stack: 0x2008_2000 (top of `SCRATCH_Y`)

## Eclipse OpenOCD launcher

## OpenOCD invocation

To run the tests, invoke them via OpenOCD:

```sh
openocd \
      -c "tcl port disabled" \
      -c "telnet port disabled" \
      -c "set USE_CORE 0" \
      -f "interface/cmsis-dap.cfg" \
      -c "adapter speed 5000" \
      -f "target/rp2350.cfg" \
      -c "program test.elf verify" \
      -c "arm semihosting enable" \
      -c "arm semihosting_cmdline test one two" \
      -c "reset"
```

## Known limitation

See [device/README.md](device/README.md) for the current status of the
RP2350 boot-ROM image metadata block, which this platform does not yet
produce.

# platforms/raspberry-pi-pico-sdk

Support files for building Cortex-M0+ tests to run on the
Raspberry Pi Pico board, with the
[Pico SDK](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/pico-sdk/).

## Prerequisites

- [Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico H](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html)
- [Raspberry Pi Debug Probe](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/debug-probe/)

The **Pico H** is a newer version, with a small 3 pin connector soldered,
which can be directly connected to the Debug Probe, without any
custom wiring.

The **Debug Probe** is a cheap SWD (Serial Wire Debug) probe, implementing
CMSIS-DAP; for best results, this probe requires a recent OpenOCD (>= 0.12),
the current Raspberry OpenOCD fork (0.11.x) is too verbose for the use with
semihosting.

An alternate setup can be a pair of Pico's (preferably the initial model,
without the debug connector soldered) and some custom wiring, with one
Pico running the [Picoprobe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe)
firmware.

## Include folders

The following folders should be passed to the compiler during the build:

- `include`

## Pico SDK integration

This platform is intended for CI and automated testing, and behaves like
the other µOS++ test platforms; the Pico SDK is used only for what is
specific to the RP2040.

- **µOS++ owns everything from the C library down**: the newlib
  syscalls (`_write()`, `_read()`, etc., over semihosting), `exit()`/
  `_exit()` (reporting the exit code to the host via semihosting),
  the startup sequence, and the heap (`_sbrk()`, from the
  `devices-raspberry-pi` package, enabled by
  `MICRO_OS_PLUS_DEVICES_RASPBERRY_PI_SDK_SBRK_ENABLED`; it grows from
  `end` to `__StackLimit`, as defined by the SDK linker script).
- **The Pico SDK provides** only the boot image and the linker script
  (`pico_standard_link`), the reset entry (`pico_crt0`), the platform
  and runtime initialisers (`pico_platform`, `pico_runtime_init`),
  the hardware drivers (`hardware_clocks`, `hardware_gpio`), and the
  CMSIS headers (`cmsis_core_headers`).
- **`pico_stdlib` and `pico_runtime` must not be linked.** They bring in
  `pico_clib_interface`, `pico_stdio`, `pico_printf`, and `pico_malloc`,
  which redefine or `--wrap` the newlib syscalls, `exit()`/`_exit()`,
  `printf()`/`puts()`/`vsnprintf()`, and `malloc()`. The result is
  either a link failure (duplicate `exit()`) or, worse, silent
  misbehaviour: both `_exit()` implementations are weak, and the SDK
  one is picked by link order, so the exit code never reaches the host;
  and the test output goes to the UART instead of semihosting.

  The SDK offers no way to keep `pico_stdlib` without these libraries:
  `pico_minimize_runtime()` controls only printf, floating point, panic,
  mutex, and thread-local support, not `pico_clib_interface` or
  `pico_stdio`. Therefore the platform links an explicit list of SDK
  targets instead, and `src/wraps.c` defines link-time tripwires that
  fail the build if the unwanted libraries return.

The start-up sequence is:

1. `pico_crt0` calls `runtime_init()`, which, without `pico_runtime`,
   is only the empty weak stub in `crt0`, then calls `main()`, wrapped
   to `__wrap_main()`.
2. `__wrap_main()` calls `micro_os_plus_startup_run_main()` (the
   Cortex-M0+ has no FPU, so there is no coprocessor to enable).
3. `micro_os_plus_startup_initialise_hardware_hook()` calls the first SDK
   hardware initialisers, in the SDK order: the early resets, the USB
   power down, the clocks, and the post-clock resets. They are excluded
   from `__preinit_array` (via the `PICO_RUNTIME_SKIP_INIT_*` definitions
   in `CMakeLists.txt`), so they run only once. The clocks are then
   available, and the hook reports the system clock frequency right after
   the CPU identification.
4. `micro_os_plus_run_init_array()` runs the `__preinit_array`, where the
   linked SDK libraries register the remaining runtime initialisers (via
   `PICO_RUNTIME_INIT_FUNC*()`), in the SDK order: the RP2040 GPIO input
   enable fix, spin locks, mutexes, the RAM vector table, the default
   alarm pool, IRQ priorities, etc. They run before the C++ static
   constructors in `__init_array`.
5. `micro_os_plus_startup_post_init_array_hook()` runs, with the
   hardware fully initialised, then `main()`.

## Source files

- `src/wraps.c` — `__wrap_main()`, the application entry point called
  by `pico_crt0` (via `-Wl,--wrap=main`), which continues with the
  µOS++ startup code, as described above; and a
  no-op replacement for `__libc_init_array()` (via
  `-Wl,--wrap=__libc_init_array`), so that, should any code call it,
  the static constructors are not run twice, since they are already run
  by `micro_os_plus_startup_run_main()` right before `main()`. It also
  defines link-time tripwires (`__wrap_printf()`, `__wrap_vsnprintf()`,
  `__wrap_malloc()`), which make the link fail with a
  `multiple definition` error if `pico_stdio`, `pico_printf`, or
  `pico_malloc` are ever linked again; they are otherwise discarded by
  `--gc-sections`.
- `src/hooks.cpp` — the µOS++ startup hooks, called from
  `micro_os_plus_startup_run_main()`/`exit()`:
  - `micro_os_plus_startup_initialise_hardware_hook()`, which calls
    the first SDK hardware initialisers, up to the clocks (see above),
    and reports the system clock frequency (`clock_get_hz (clk_sys)`);
    the remaining SDK initialisers and the static constructors have not
    run yet at this point;
  - `micro_os_plus_startup_post_init_array_hook()`, which turns on the
    `activity_led` (`platform::led_green`); being called after the
    static constructors, the LED object is already initialised;
  - `micro_os_plus_startup_finalise_hardware_hook()`, which turns the
    `activity_led` off, right before the session terminates.
- `src/led-green.cpp` — `platform::led_green` driver for the
  onboard green LED (`PICO_DEFAULT_LED_PIN`), implemented on top of the
  Pico SDK's own `hardware_gpio` driver, unlike the sibling
  raspberry-pi-pico platform, which drives the RP2040 CMSIS registers
  directly.

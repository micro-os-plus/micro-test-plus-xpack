# platforms/nucleo-f411re-cubemx-startup

Note: It cannot be a static library, since it makes extensive use of `weak` symbols.

## Source files

- `src/hooks.cpp` — the `micro_os_plus_startup_initialise_hardware_hook`,
  `micro_os_plus_startup_post_init_array_hook` and
  `micro_os_plus_startup_finalise_hardware_hook` hooks (called from
  `micro_os_plus_startup_run_main()`/`exit()`). `initialise_hardware_hook`
  simply calls the CubeMX-generated `cubemx_main()` (`main()` renamed,
  see `device/README.md`), which brings up the clocks and configures
  the LD2 pin. The other two hooks instantiate the `activity_led`
  (`platform::led_green`), turning it on/off around the application's
  run. `led_green` has no data members and a trivial default
  constructor, so there is no actual ordering hazard;
  `post_init_array_hook` is used simply as the conventional point,
  once the C++ runtime is fully up, to touch peripherals. No
  `initialise_hardware_early_hook` is needed, as
  `initialise_hardware_hook` already brings up the clocks and the LD2
  pin.
- `src/led-green.cpp` — `platform::led_green`
  driver for the onboard green LED (`LD2`, `PA5`), implemented on top of
  the STM32F4xx HAL's `HAL_GPIO_*()` calls, already linked in via
  `stm32cubemx-drivers-objects-library` (see `device/CMakeLists.txt`).

## OpenOCD invocation

To run the tests, invoke them via OpenOCD:

```sh
openocd \
      -c "gdb port disabled" \
      -c "tcl port disabled" \
      -c "telnet port disabled" \
      -f interface/stlink-dap.cfg \
      -c "adapter speed 5000" \
      -f target/stm32f4x.cfg \
      -c "program test.elf verify" \
      -c "arm semihosting enable" \
      -c "arm semihosting_cmdline test one two" \
      -c "reset"
```

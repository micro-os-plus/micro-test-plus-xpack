# Create Issue — µTest++ Testing Framework

## When to Use

- The user asks to add, open, create or file a GitHub issue for a bug or an
  enhancement.
- The user asks to turn the findings of a review (code, API, Doxygen,
  website) into issues, one issue per finding.

Issues are opened in `micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus-xpack` with the `gh`
CLI, run from the repository root.

## Procedure

1. **Establish the facts.** Read the code the issue refers to, at the
   current `HEAD`, and record the exact files and the function or
   member names, and, as a secondary pointer, the line numbers. Do not
   cite line numbers from memory or from an earlier version of the
   file. If the working tree has uncommitted changes in the cited
   files, cite the lines as they are in the committed version, or say
   so in the body.
2. **Reproduce, if it is a bug.** When it is practical, confirm the
   behaviour with a probe, a test run, or the output of the sample
   programs, and keep the evidence (the command, the configuration
   name, and the relevant output) to show the user; the body of the
   issue has only the condensed form (see "Length"). State clearly what
   was measured and what was only estimated or inferred.
3. **Check for duplicates.** Search the open and closed issues:

   ```sh
   gh issue list --repo micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus-xpack \
     --state all --limit 30 --search "<keywords>"
   ```

   If an issue already covers the problem, report it to the user
   instead of creating a new one, and offer to add a comment to it.
   If a related issue exists, reference it in the body (see below).
4. **Choose the labels** (see "Labels") **and the milestone** (see
   "Milestone").
5. **Draft the title and the body** (see "Title" and "Body"), and write
   the body to a file in the scratchpad folder.
6. **Show the draft to the user** — the title, the labels, the
   milestone, and the full body — and wait for explicit approval.
   Opening an issue is a public action; never create one, or a
   milestone, without approval. For several issues, present all drafts
   together and let the user approve, edit, or drop each of them.
7. **Create the issue:**

   ```sh
   gh issue create --repo micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus-xpack \
     --title "<title>" \
     --label <label> [--label <label>] \
     --milestone "<milestone>" \
     --assignee @me \
     --body-file <scratchpad>/issue-body.md
   ```

   Always assign the issue to the current GitHub user (`--assignee
   @me`, the account `gh` is authenticated as). Omit `--milestone` only
   when the user confirmed that no milestone applies.
8. **Report** the issue number and URL. When several issues are created,
   list them as a table (number, title, labels, milestone).

## Labels

Use only the repository labels below, unless the user asks otherwise:

- `bug` — the code behaves incorrectly: wrong or invalid output (for
  example TAP that is not valid YAML), crashes, faults, undefined
  behaviour, compilation failures with a supported toolchain, or
  behaviour that contradicts the documentation (the issue is a `bug`
  whichever of the two is wrong; the proposed change says which one to
  correct).
- `enhancement` — the code works, but can be improved: refactorings,
  duplicated code, inconsistent naming or macros, performance, memory
  footprint, missing features, API additions, and documentation
  wording.
- Both `bug` and `enhancement` — when a defect can only be fixed by a
  new feature or a new public API (for example a missing extension
  point whose absence leads to a failure).

The `documentation` label is not used; documentation issues are labelled
`enhancement` when the text is correct but can be improved, and `bug`
when it is wrong or contradicts the code. If the kind is
uncertain, say so and ask the user.

## Title

- State the **current problem**, not the fix: the title describes what
  is wrong or missing, in the present tense, as a full sentence.
  - Good: `The TAP reporter formats most of its lines twice`
  - Good: `` `initialise (argc, argv)` handles a second call twice ``
  - Bad: `Refactor the TAP reporter output` (describes the fix).
  - Bad: `Fix stack overflow` (imperative, vague).
- Usually start with `The ...`, or with the code identifier in
  backticks.
- Capitalise the first word, unless it is a code identifier in
  backticks; do not end with a period.
- Keep it under 70 characters.
- Do not prefix it with the kind (`Bug:`, `[enhancement]`) or an issue
  number; the labels carry the kind.

## Body

Write the body as plain Markdown prose, kept short (see "Length"), in
British English, formal, with no contractions, the Oxford comma, and the
lines wrapped at 72 characters. Use backticks for file names,
identifiers, macros, options, configuration names, and commit hashes.
Do not use headings or templates (no "Steps to reproduce" / "Expected" /
"Actual" sections); the information is given as connected sentences, in
this order, merged into the two paragraphs allowed by "Length", with
only the parts that the issue needs:

1. **Location.** Open with the file and the function or member, and,
   when it helps, the line numbers, followed by a colon, for example:
   `` `src/runner.cpp`, `runner::initialise()`, lines 163 to 166: `` or
   `` `tests/sources/suite/src/suite.cpp`, `nested_test_case()`: ``.
   The function or member name is required; the line numbers are not,
   because they change with the first edit of the file.
   Paths are relative to the repository root, except for headers
   under `include/micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus/`, which may be given
   by their name (`detail.h`, `inlines/detail-inlines.h`).
2. **Observation.** What the code does, precisely: the configuration
   and the command, the observed output or fault, and the cause, if
   known. For a bug, include the evidence from the reproduction and
   mark estimates as estimates. Mention a related commit by its short
   hash only when it bears on the cause (it introduced the problem, or
   it is not the cause).
3. **Scope.** Only when it changes the decision: which other
   platforms, toolchains, or files are, or may be, affected, and why a
   passing case does not prove the absence of the problem.
4. **Proposed change.** In the imperative (`Remove it.`, `Add to
   `reporter` a variadic helper ...`, `Measure ..., and then either
   ...`). When several solutions are possible, list them and state the
   trade-offs; do not pretend that one is obviously right. Mention any
   test to add, and any generated file whose template must be changed
   instead (for example the build-helper templates of the platforms,
   followed by `npm run generate-tests-commons` in `tests/`).
5. **References**, if any, as a final short paragraph, for example
   `Found while fixing #134.` or `Decide together with #118.`

### Length

Issues are read by the maintainer, who knows the code: keep them short.

- The body has at most two paragraphs (the location and the observation
  together, then the proposed change), plus the final reference line,
  and normally no more than 12 lines of 72 characters.
- Cite the location once, with the primary file and the first line or
  the function name; do not list every affected line, file, or
  declaration.
- State the evidence in a clause (the failing expression and the
  result, with the configuration in brackets), not as a narrative; give
  the full output only when it is needed to understand the problem.
- Omit what the reader can see in the code or in the title, the
  background of the feature, the scope, and the trade-offs, unless they
  change the decision (the scope and the trade-offs of the proposed
  change are the only such cases); the proposal is a single sentence,
  or a short list when there are several solutions.
- Do not describe the work already done on the fix.

A simple finding is a single paragraph of two to four lines.

## Milestone

- List the open milestones:

  ```sh
  gh api repos/micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus-xpack/milestones \
    --jq '.[] | "\(.title)\t\(.description)"'
  ```

- Propose the appropriate one in the draft (usually the milestone of
  the next release; a breaking change belongs to the next major
  release), and assign it with `--milestone`.
- If no milestone is applicable, ask the user whether to proceed
  without one or to create one. Creating a milestone is a public
  action: show its title and description, wait for approval, and then
  create it with `gh api --method POST
  repos/micro-os-plus/micro-test-plus-xpack/milestones -f
  title="<title>"`.

## Issues from Review Findings

When the findings of a review (for example `maintenance/docs/API-REVIEW-<n>.md`)
are turned into issues:

- Write one issue per numbered finding, and do not group independent
  findings; each issue is self-contained and does not rely on the
  review file, which may be uncommitted. Do not cite the number of the
  finding in the title or in the body (it is not a GitHub number, and
  would be confused with one).
- Take the location, the evidence, and the proposed change from the
  finding, and check them against the current `HEAD` (step 1), because
  the review may be older than the code.
- Check for duplicates for each finding (step 3).
- After the issue is created, the number of the issue is recorded in
  the review document, as described under "Review Documents" in
  `.github/skills/github-commit/SKILL.md`; ask the user before editing
  the document.

## Example

Title: `The quiet summary omits the count of the skipped test cases`

Labels: `bug`

```markdown
`src/reporter-human.cpp`, `end_session()`: with `--quiet`, the final
summary prints the passed and failed checks, but not the skipped test
cases, which the normal verbosity reports; a session in which all the
test cases are skipped is therefore reported as passed with no checks.
Print the skipped count in the quiet summary as well, when it is not
zero, and update `tests/expected/txt/unit-test-console-quiet.txt`.

Found while fixing #NNN.
```

(The example is hypothetical; it illustrates the format only.)

## After the Issue Is Fixed

The fix is committed with the `github-commit` skill, which also adds
the closing comment to the issue (see its "Issue Comment" section); the
issue is not closed by hand.
